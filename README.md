# Simon Game

Project Overview: For this course project, you will build a Simon Game using JavaScript, following the guidance and structure provided by Angela Yu's course on The Complete Web Development Bootcamp. This project will allow you to practice and reinforce your understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, event handling, arrays, DOM manipulation, and creating interactive web applications.

Project Description: The Simon Game is a memory game where players must repeat a sequence of colors and sounds. The sequence grows with each round, and the player must click the colored buttons in the same order to progress. The game ends if the player clicks the wrong button.

Key Features:
Color Sequence Generation:

The game generates a random sequence of colors from a set of four buttons (red, blue, green, yellow).
The sequence starts with one color and grows by one color after each round.
User Interaction:

The player must click the colored buttons in the same order as the generated sequence.
Each button click should be highlighted (e.g., by adding a "pressed" class).
If the player clicks the wrong button, the game resets.
Audio Feedback:

Each button corresponds to a sound file (e.g., red.mp3, blue.mp3) which plays when the user clicks a button or when the sequence is shown.
Visual Feedback:

Buttons should visually respond to clicks with animations, such as fading in and out or scaling effects.
The background color of the page could change based on the game's status (e.g., green when the player is correct, red when the player makes a mistake).
Score Tracking:

The game should display the player's current score (number of successful rounds completed).
If the player fails to match the sequence, the game should show an alert or message with the score and restart the game.
Restart Game:

The game should reset when the player loses, including resetting the score and sequence.
